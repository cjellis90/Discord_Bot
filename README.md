# Discord_Bot
This was a hobby project for a Discord channel I was in. This channel had a membership subscription and the bot was written to help that process

This bot will:

 * Display a gretting message to new members
 * Connect to a backend google sheet that holds membership information to track subscription start and end dates
 * Displays help me command to help users understand all commands
 * Can give users of channel information about subscription details
 * Has a percentage calculator
 * Can display trade targets from an entry value

This bot will need tokens from Discord as well as OAUth account credentials to run.
